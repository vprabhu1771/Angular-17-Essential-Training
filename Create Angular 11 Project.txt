To create a new Angular project with Angular version 11, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install Angular CLI**: If you haven't installed the Angular CLI, you can do so by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

2. **Create a new Angular project**: To create a new Angular project with Angular version 11 specifically, you need to specify the version while creating the project. You can do this by using the `--version` flag:

   ```bash
   ng new my-angular-project --version=11
   ```

3. **Navigate to the project directory**: Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-angular-project
   ```

4. **Serve the project**: To run the project, use the following command:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   This will start a development server, and you can view your new Angular project in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:4200`.

Here is a step-by-step example:

```bash
# Install Angular CLI globally if not already installed
npm install -g @angular/cli

# Create a new Angular project with version 11
ng new my-angular-project --version=11

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my-angular-project

# Serve the project
ng serve
```

This process will create a new Angular project using Angular 11, and you can start developing your application immediately.
