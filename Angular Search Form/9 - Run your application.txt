ng serve

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:4200/. You should see your Angular app with a search form.

This is a basic example, and you'll need to replace the search logic in the onSubmit method with your actual search implementation, 
such as calling an API or searching through local data. Also, consider using services for more complex data operations and handling state.
