track for calculating difference of two collections


The value of the track expression determines a key used to associate array items with the views in the DOM. Having clear indication of the item identity allows Angular to execute a minimal set of DOM operations as items are added, removed or moved in a collection.

Using track effectively can significantly enhance your application's performance, especially in loops over data collections.

For collections that do not undergo modifications (no items are moved, added, or deleted), using track $index is an efficient strategy. For collections with mutable data or frequent changes, select a property that uniquely identifies each item to use as your track expression.

Be aware of the potential for increased DOM re-creation when using object identity as a track key with immutable data structures, as this can lead to unnecessary performance costs.
